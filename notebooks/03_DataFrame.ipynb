    "## Welcome to 03_DataFrames\n",
    "This is where your previously learnt class will start to hopefully make sense in a table data environment.\n",
    "Although manipulating tables and dataframes in python/R and excel has not much differences in outcome,\n",
    "the massive gain from control, speed, read and write ability justifies moving workflow to any programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "### 03_DataFrames Goals:\n",
    "- Read and write DataFrames\n",
    "- Exploring types in DataFrames\n",
    "- Indexing and subsetting DataFrames\n",
    "- Joins, Merge, Pivot\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is the first part of the Data Science cycle, where we will learn to import and tidy the data\n",

    "#### Introducing CSV\n",
    "If you have always used excels, you realised that excel has a row limit of 1,048,576 until it requires another sheet\n",
    "If you use any other operating system, you need an excel license to read xlsx.\n",
    "CSV (aka. Comma Separated Value) is a:\n",
    "- Platform independent\n",
    "- Basic\n",
    "- Row-based dataframe format\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggest values are comma separated, you can open up `../data/external/module_info.csv` to take a look!\n",
    "The advantages of using CSV:\n",
    "- Can be edited with any basic text editing software (notepad, excel, word...)\n",
    "- Much faster read and write in any programming language\n",
    "- Does not take up all your memory (i.e. No more excel crashes)\n",
    "- Forces standard format in tables (1 row index, 1 column index)\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of using CSV:\n",
    "- No cool excel like collaborative \n",
    "- No excel functions (<-- We can just do all of this in python)\n",
    "- No colours\n",
    "- No crazy multi-column, multi-row index support (This forces good practice)\n",
    "\n",
    "In E&S data, we have a lot of \",\" in our Answers field, therefore we will use semi-colon \";\" as a separator instead!"
